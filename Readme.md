# DK-Freerun-Edition

This is a rom-hack of the original arcade Donkey Kong game.

In the Freerun Edition you can play the complete game without enemies. So there are no barrels, no fireballs/firefoxes, no pies and no springs. You are free to roam the level screens for as long as the bonus timer allows. But beware: you still die when you fall off a girder, fall through a rivet hole, jump in a burning oil can or miscalculate a jump to an elevator. The faster you run through a level the more points earned based on the time remaining on the bonus timer. Points are also be earned by picking up the bonus items just like in the original game. 

I'm a lousy Donkey Kong player and will probably never be able to experience the famous kill screen myself playing the original game. But this Freerun Edition made me do it: I reached the kill screen ... after more than an hour of pointless running and climbing. But then something interesting happened. Because there are no enemies you can speed through the barrel screen and actually make it to the top in the short amount of time that is given. So I could also run the conveyor screen on level 22! However, on the next barrel screen I was to slow and got the kill just before reaching Pauline.
